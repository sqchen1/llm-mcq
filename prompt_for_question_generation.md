You are a senior business analyst at a big tech company. Your task is to design some evaluation questions to measure the logical reasoning capability of the company’s self-developed business analysis agent. Please create five multiple-choice questions, each reflecting realistic business analysis scenarios (e.g., growth diagnosis, A/B testing interpretation, market share reasoning, causal inference, or financial performance analysis). 
Each question should include: 
    1. One well-structured question with a short business context. 
    2. Four answer options (A–D), with only one correct answer. 
    3. A clearly indicated correct answer. 
Only provide the questions, options, and correct answers — do not include explanations or additional comments.
